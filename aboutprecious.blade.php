							<h3>Hi I'm Precious Ime M. Lumandas! 20 years old from Capulaan Balungao, Pangasinan. I was born in Quezon Province until when I grow up, but when I'm in the college, my parents decided to study me here in Pangasinan. I am a 3rd year student at the Urdaneta City University(UCU) majoring in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<br><br>
						


						Going to college and prepping for the “real world” is not easy. Dealing with grades, studying, bills, pressure from your parents, and having to answer the big question: “What should I do with my life? “, there's a lot of expectations on your plate. Here are the things that makes me feel down.Many challenges comes in my life but giving up is not a way to end this problem. As a student, I need a person who always there through ups and down but there's a time no one does and the only person who will trust you most is yourself and the Lord.Always believe on yourself whatever your decisions in life.Don't forget to pray always because God will always guide us in a right path. God has a better plan for us. God Bless!
